              Sometimes, when you write, you get so stuck in your own head that what you write doesn't quite appear the same to the outside world.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created some algorithms to analyse your novel. We have some simple algorithms that analyse things like pace and readability.
            But what we think is most interesting is we have created an alogorithm that 'understands' the sentiment of your work.
          </p>
          <p>
            We then plot this on a really easy to digest, interactive, plot for you to use.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, we feel, is that your document <b>will not be saved anywhere</b>. No databases, nothing. Once you refresh the page your analysis will dissapear forver.
