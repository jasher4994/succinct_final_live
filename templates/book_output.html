            <ul>
              <li>Are there any points where the pace of my work and sentiment move together? It could be interesting to observe how the pace of your text changes with sentiment. </li>
              <li>What are the most difficult parts of your text to read. Some readers can be put off by difficult beginnings to documents. </li>
              <li>At peak moments, are you writing at an impactful pace?</li>
              <li>Is the sentiment of certain sections as you'd expect it to be?</li>

              The sentiment score (the yellow) is the computers understanding of the sentiment of your text. Our algorithms understand the sentiment of all words in the english language and average them out across sentences. 
              Of course, adjustments are also made for nuances in the english language such as negation words like 'not' or enhancing words such as 'very' or 'extremely'.

          <p class="card-text">
            Pace is metric that we made ourselves - pace  doesn't necessarily mean a book is shorter in pacier sections. It's about how the story flows and the pace of events happening in regards to character development and description. In short pace describes how much action is going on and the speed it arrives.

          <h5 class="card-title text-center">What does this mean?</h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Pace and Readability are inherently intertwined - short sentences are easier to read. But they aren't identical. Our readability metric is the Fleschâ€“Kincaid score - used by the U.S milatary.
          </p>
        </p> We plot them on the same graph so you can see the relationship between all of our metrics. Our metrics are useful together as well as in isolation.
